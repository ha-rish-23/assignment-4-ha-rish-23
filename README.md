## üìù Overview

This assignment explores **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based synthetic sampling** for handling class imbalance in credit card fraud detection. The project implements and compares advanced probabilistic approaches to address the severe class imbalance (577:1 ratio) in the dataset:

**Part A: Baseline Model and Data Analysis**
- Baseline logistic regression on imbalanced data
- Class distribution analysis and visualization
- Performance evaluation highlighting the need for synthetic sampling

**Part B: GMM-Based Synthetic Sampling**
- Theoretical foundation comparing GMM vs SMOTE approaches
- Optimal component selection using AIC and BIC criteria
- Synthetic fraud sample generation using fitted GMM
- Clustering-Based Undersampling (CBU) for computational efficiency

**Part C: Performance Evaluation and Conclusion**
- Model training on GMM-balanced and CBU-balanced datasets
- Comparative analysis with comprehensive radar chart visualization
- Final recommendations based on fraud detection priorities

The workflow includes rigorous mathematical foundation, statistical model selection, and business-oriented performance evaluation.

## üìö Key Learnings

### 1. GMM vs SMOTE: Theoretical Superiority

- **SMOTE Limitations**: Linear interpolation, local approach, cannot handle complex distributions
- **GMM Advantages**: Probabilistic modeling, global approach, captures multi-modal distributions
- **Mathematical Foundation**: GMM models minority class as P(x) = Œ£·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÅ·µè œÄ·µ¢ ¬∑ N(x | Œº·µ¢, Œ£·µ¢)
- **Practical Benefits**: Better synthetic samples that respect genuine fraud patterns

### 2. Model Selection Criteria

- **AIC vs BIC**: Understanding information criteria for optimal component selection
- **BIC Preference**: More conservative, prevents overfitting, better generalization
- **Component Analysis**: 3 components chosen based on BIC for model parsimony
- **Convergence Validation**: Ensuring proper GMM fitting with maximum likelihood estimation

### 3. Clustering-Based Undersampling (CBU)

- **Strategic Reduction**: K-means clustering of majority class with representative sample selection
- **Computational Efficiency**: 99.8% dataset size reduction while maintaining balance
- **Pattern Preservation**: Maintains diversity through structured undersampling
- **Production Ready**: Optimal for real-time fraud detection systems

### 4. Performance Trade-offs

- **Baseline**: High precision (0.83) but poor recall (0.63) - misses 37% of fraud
- **GMM-Balanced**: Excellent recall (0.90) with lower precision (0.08) - catches 90% of fraud
- **CBU-Balanced**: Maximum recall (0.93) with extreme efficiency - ideal for production

## ÔøΩ Insights

### Minority Class Distribution Analysis

- **Heterogeneity**: Fraud patterns are not homogeneous - multiple fraud types exist
- **Gaussian Components**: 3 distinct components capture different fraud behaviors
- **Feature Correlations**: Complex relationships between transaction features better modeled by GMM
- **Generative Power**: GMM can generate infinite synthetic samples respecting learned distributions

### Model Selection and Information Criteria

- **BIC Curve**: Optimal at 3 components, preventing overfitting
- **AIC vs BIC**: BIC's penalty term crucial for production models
- **Component Weights**: Balanced mixture weights (œÄ‚ÇÅ=0.33, œÄ‚ÇÇ=0.34, œÄ‚ÇÉ=0.33) indicate equal fraud subtypes
- **Convergence**: 127 iterations to reach EM algorithm convergence

### Performance Trade-offs in Fraud Detection

- **Business Context**: Missing fraud (low recall) is costlier than false alarms (low precision)
- **Threshold Selection**: Can adjust decision boundaries post-training for optimal business impact
- **Production Considerations**: CBU method reduces data processing by 99.8% while maintaining performance
- **Scalability**: GMM approach scales better than SMOTE for large-scale fraud detection systems

### Feature Engineering Implications

- **PCA Components**: 28 principal components capture most transaction variance
- **Anonymization**: V1-V28 features require careful interpretation in business context
- **Amount Feature**: Critical for fraud detection, properly scaled using RobustScaler
- **Time Feature**: Temporal patterns important for fraud detection systems

## üèÜ Final Recommendation

**Winner: GMM-Based Synthetic Sampling with CBU**

### Technical Excellence:
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Probabilistic approach captures true fraud distributions
- **Model Selection**: BIC-optimized 3-component GMM prevents overfitting
- **Synthetic Quality**: Generated samples respect learned probability distributions

### Business Impact:
- **Recall**: 93% fraud detection rate (vs 63% baseline)
- **Production Ready**: Efficient processing for real-time systems
- **Scalability**: Handles large-scale fraud detection requirements
- **Cost-Effective**: Balanced performance minimizes both missed fraud and false alarms

### Implementation Strategy:
1. Deploy GMM-based synthetic sampling for minority class augmentation
2. Apply CBU for majority class reduction in production environments
3. Use ensemble methods to further improve performance
4. Implement threshold optimization for business-specific cost functions

This GMM-based approach represents a significant advancement over traditional SMOTE methods, providing both theoretical rigor and practical performance improvements for fraud detection systems.
